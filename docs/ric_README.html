version 1.0


This document will assist you with setting up and exploring all the possibilities of this library.


1) Introduction
----------------

Make your website super fast by using caching! Everyone hates it when they have to wait for more than three seconds to view 
a webpage. Reasons for slowness are sudden traffic spikes, slow database servers, complex number crunching, ...

The easiest way to speed up any website is by caching the data that makes it slow. Enter MegaCache!

2) Features
-----------

- Eight adapters. Store your cache where and how you want.
- Function call caching. Cache the results of functions.
- Resource caching. Cache external resources such as API calls (Twitter, ...) for a predefined amount of time.
- Easy to use and implement.
- Statistics. Check the hits and misses of each cache call.
- Array access. Treat your cache object like an array!
- Documented code!


3) Adapters
-----------

MegaCache is bundled with 8 adapters (8 different ways to cache your data):

- Null: 
	the most basic of caching strategies. Keeps things in memory and forgets them after the page is loaded. Use if you
	don't have any other option.
- Sqlite: 
	uses the built in Sqlite support. Sqlite is an embedded database (you don't have to install anything) with some
	advanced features (such as locking) that performs quite well. Very fast if you read a lot of data, slower
	if you write a lot of data.
- SingleFile:
	stores everything in a single file. Very fast but not thread-safe (meaning that if two users make the same
	request the last write will be remembered).
- Session: 
	stores data in the user's $_SESSION variable. Fast but not persistent across users.
- APC: 
	stores data in memory thanks to the APC (Alternative PHP Cache). The fastest across the board. Requires the APC
	extension.
- Memcache and Memcached:
	two adapters to connect to one or more Memcached servers. The first one requires the memcache extension, the 
	second one required the memcached extension. Recommended for large installations.
- PDO:
    	utilizes the Portable Data Objects extension which enables you to connect to a large number of different databases.
    	Only tested with MySQL but should work with most vendors.
	
4) Initialization
-----------------

This library comes with a factory class that allows you to initialize any adapter. Usage is very simple:

&lt;?php
require('path/to/CacheFactory.php');
$cache = CacheFactory::factory('Apc', $configArray='');
?&gt; 

The first argument is the adapter name, the second one is an array containing configuration options. Please consult the class documentation
to view the configuration options for each adapter.

5) Usage
---------

	----------------
	a) storing data
	----------------
	
	$cache-&gt;set('myVar', $value, $timeout);
	
	Stores $value in myVar for $timeout seconds. If you pass 0 then it will be cached forever (or until the cache gets full or cleared).
	
	-----------------
	b) fetching data
	-----------------
	
	$value = $cache-&gt;get('myVar');
	
	returns the data or false
	
	-----------------
	c) deleting data
	-----------------
	
	$cache-&gt;delete('myVar');


6) Function caching
--------------------

In many situations you'll want to cache the result of a function. Say for example we have a very complicated and time consuming function that
takes two numbers and makes the sum of both:

function sum($a, $b) {
	sleep(5); // we have to simulate it's complicated right?
}

Normally you would do:

echo &quot;The sum of $a and $b is &quot; . sum($a, $b);

And you would see the result 5 seconds later. With MegaCache you can simply do:

echo &quot;The sum of $a and $b is &quot; . $cache-&gt;call('sum', array($a, $b), 120);

The first time will also take 5 seconds. However, afterwards the result will be cached for 120 seconds and your complex calculation will be executed.
If you change a or b, the function will run again.


7) Fragment caching
--------------------

Often only parts of your website need to be cached. This can be accomplished with fragment caching.

Take for example this code:

$newsticker = new NewsTicker(); // an imaginary widget that does a lot of processing
foreach($newsticker-&gt;news as $item) {
	echo &quot;&lt;h2&gt;Item&lt;/h2&gt;&quot;;
}

If you want this fragment of your page to be cached simply wrap it in a fragment conditional.

if(!$cache-&gt;fragment('newsticker')) {
	$newsticker = new NewsTicker(); // an imaginary widget that does a lot of processing
	foreach($newsticker-&gt;news as $item) {
		echo &quot;&lt;h2&gt;Item&lt;/h2&gt;&quot;;
	}	
	$this-&gt;saveFragment(300);
}

This will cache the newsticker component for 5 minutes. Each next page view the fragment call will automatically output the newsticker.


8) Resource caching
--------------------

Pretend you want to show a Twitter feed on your webpage. Normally every page load will fetch your Twitter RSS feed. Since Twitter can be slow,
your website may also feel slow sometimes.

Normally you would do:

$twitter = file_get_contents('http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/61297416.rss');
// and then mark up this code

With MegaCache you can simply do:
$twitter = $cache-&gt;fetch('http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/61297416.rss', 300);

And your twitter feed will be cached for 5 minutes!


9) Statistics
--------------

If you call $cache-&gt;getStats(); you will receive an array containing all the hits, misses, sets, deletes, gets, ... of both the current page view (session) 
and the sum of all requests.


10) Array access
---------------

At any time you can use your cache object like an array. Sets made will have timeout 0.

$cache-&gt;set('myVar', 10);
echo $cache['myVar']; //10


11) Directory layout
--------------------

lib
  - the directory containing the library
docs
  - the documentation you are reading now
test
  - simple testing and benchmarking for the various adapters


12) Benchmarking
-----------------

The test directory contains a small test scenario that measures the speed of the various adapters. This is not a real world test (at all) 
but it gives a good indication of the speed of the various adapters.

These are my results.
	- Null: disqualified since it is not persistent.
	- Sqlite: 1,5x faster than without caching. Main reason is it seems to be very slow on inserts.
	- SingleFile: 45x faster than without caching.
	- Session: 6x faster.
	- APC: 51x faster. Use this!
	- Memcache: 16x faster.
	- Memcached: 13x faster. Weird enough slower than Memcache across the board (library overhead?).
	- PDO: 5x faster. Also slower because of DB inserts.


13) More information
--------------------

Please consult the examples in test or the code documetation for in-depth documentation.
